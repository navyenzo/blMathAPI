blMathAPI is a collection of algorithms and data structures that I've developed and used over the years for various projects, some of which are:

-- Simple generic mathematical functions, especially useful on platforms where there's no STL

-- Iterator based Buffer parsing algorithms, some of them like the ones from the STL, but that can also work with circular buffers unlike STL algorithms

-- Simple string to number conversions that can be used to parse text buffers

-- Simple mathematical data structures
